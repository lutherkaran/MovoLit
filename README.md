If so, then you're in luck because we've got just the game for you! Get ready to immerse yourself in a world of darkness, where the only way to move forward is with the help of a trusty torch.

In this multi-level puzzle game, you'll be tasked with guiding your character through a series of dark environments to reach the finishing point.
